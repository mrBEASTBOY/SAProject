# Set up minimal security for elastic, kibana
1. On every node in your cluster, add the xpack.security.enabled setting to the $ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml file and set the value to true:
xpack.security.enabled: true

2. On every node in your cluster, start Elasticsearch. For example, if you installed Elasticsearch with a .tar.gz package, run the following command from the ES_HOME directory:
./bin/elasticsearch

3. In another terminal window, set the passwords for the built-in users by running the elasticsearch-setup-passwords utility.
run the command with the interactive parameter instead of the auto parameter. Using this mode steps you through password configuration for all of the built-in users. Set the password for everything as "linh1997"
./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive

4. Save the generated passwords. Youâ€™ll need them to add the built-in user to Kibana.

5. Add the elasticsearch.username setting to the KIB_PATH_CONF/kibana.yml file and set the value to the kibana_system user:
elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"

6. From the directory where you installed Kibana, run the following commands to create the Kibana keystore and add the secure settings:
a. Create the Kibana keystore:
./bin/kibana-keystore create
b. Add the password for the kibana_system user to the Kibana keystore. Enter the password as "linh1997":
./bin/kibana-keystore add elasticsearch.password

7. Start kibana, username is "elastic", password is "linh1997"
./bin/kibana

8. Start logstash.bat
